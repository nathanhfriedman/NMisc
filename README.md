# NMisc

A package containing functions I've found useful during my time doing data science with R.

3 functions are included in this package:
- stata_join
  A function for doing merges in R slightly less blindly
- bind_cols_fill
  An adaptation of bind_cols, suitable for data frame with differing numbers of rows
- xy_compare
  A function that compares columns within a merged data frame

Details about each function can be found in their respective scripts.

The packages required to run these functions can be found in the file:
00 - dependencies.R
